# JABS Javascript-calender
## HTML & CSS
The HTML code creates a simple interactive calendar with navigation buttons, a month selector, and clickable days. The styling is done using CSS to make it visually appealing. You can customize the styling and add more features based on your needs. Note that the interaction is currently limited to showing an alert when a day is clicked, and you might want to replace that with your specific functionality.
### "javascript"
These create some user friendly interface ,though the purpose was to index some html functionality directky .you can also try using UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName(), can be  used to apply the system's default look and feel to your Swing application, giving it a more native and professional appearance. The styling may vary depending on the operating system. 

why the <\html & css> does the web application interface..,
Enjoy coding ...
